      <h1>Interpreting the Ideal Gas Law at Particle Level</h1>
      <p class="meta">

      <p>
        The ideal gas law,
        \[
          pV = nRT,
        \]
        relates the pressure \(p\), volume \(V\), amount of gas \(n\),
        temperature \(T\), and the gas constant \(R\). It summarizes how a
        gas sample responds when these macroscopic quantities are changed.
      </p>

      <h2>Microscopic Picture</h2>
      <p>
        In the kinetic theory of gases, a gas consists of many small particles
        (atoms or molecules) moving randomly. The pressure exerted on the walls
        of a container arises from collisions of these particles with the walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        For an ideal gas, particles are assumed to have negligible volume
        compared to the container and to experience no intermolecular forces
        except during collisions. Under these assumptions, it can be shown
        that the average translational kinetic energy is
        \[
          \langle E_k \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2}k_B T,
        \]
        where \(k_B\) is Boltzmann's constant.
      </p>

      <h2>Connecting to Temperature</h2>
      <p>
        Temperature in this model is a measure of the average kinetic energy
        of the particles. Raising the temperature increases the typical speed
        of the molecules, which leads to more frequent and more energetic
        collisions with the container walls and therefore higher pressure
        if volume is held constant.
      </p>

      <h2>When the Ideal Gas Law Breaks Down</h2>
      <p>
        Real gases deviate from ideal behaviour at high pressures and low
        temperatures, where the assumptions of negligible particle volume and
        zero intermolecular forces are no longer valid. Under those conditions
        more detailed equations of state, such as the van der Waals equation,
        are used.
