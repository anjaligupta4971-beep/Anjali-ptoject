      <h1>Acid-Base Chemistry: pH and Buffers</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Topic: Acid-Base Chemistry · Level: General Chemistry
      </p>

      <p>
        Acids and bases are fundamental to many chemical processes in nature and
        industry. Understanding their behavior, particularly through the pH scale
        and buffer systems, is essential for chemistry students.
      </p>

      <h2>Acids and Bases</h2>
      <p>
        According to the Brønsted-Lowry definition, an acid is a substance that
        donates protons (H⁺ ions), while a base accepts protons. When an acid
        and base react, they form water and a salt in a neutralization
        reaction. For example:
        \[
          \text{HCl} + \text{NaOH} \rightarrow \text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O}
        \]
      </p>

      <h2>The pH Scale</h2>
      <p>
        The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of a solution, ranging
        from 0 to 14. It is defined as:
        \[
          \text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+],
        \]
        where \([\text{H}^+]\) is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles
        per liter. A pH of 7 is neutral (pure water), pH less than 7 is
        acidic, and pH greater than 7 is basic.
      </p>

      <p>
        The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning each unit represents a tenfold
        change in hydrogen ion concentration. For example, a solution with pH 3
        has ten times more H⁺ ions than a solution with pH 4.
      </p>

      <h2>Buffers</h2>
      <p>
        Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base
        are added. They typically consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base
        (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). The buffer capacity depends on
        the concentrations of the buffer components.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation describes buffer pH:
        \[
          \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]},
        \]
        where \(K_a\) is the acid dissociation constant, \([\text{A}^-]\) is
        the concentration of the conjugate base, and \([\text{HA}]\) is the
        concentration of the weak acid.
      </p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Buffer systems are crucial in biological systems. Blood, for example,
        maintains a pH around 7.4 using a carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer
        system. Understanding pH and buffers is also essential in industrial
        processes, environmental science, and many laboratory procedures.
