      <h1>Wave–Particle Duality and Electron Diffraction</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Topic: Quantum / Waves · Level: Intro to Modern Physics
      </p>

      <p>
        In classical physics, waves and particles are treated as very different
        objects. A particle such as a small steel ball travels along a
        trajectory, while a water wave spreads out and shows interference
        when it meets an obstacle. In quantum physics, experiments show that
        microscopic particles such as electrons can display both types of
        behaviour.
      </p>

      <h2>Electron Diffraction</h2>
      <p>
        When a beam of electrons is directed at a thin crystal, such as a
        graphite foil, a pattern of bright and dark rings can be observed on
        a fluorescent screen. This pattern is very similar to the diffraction
        pattern obtained when light waves pass through a grating, and it is
        strong evidence that electrons have wave-like properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        The de Broglie relation assigns a wavelength \(\lambda\) to a
        particle of momentum \(p\):
        \[
          \lambda = \dfrac{h}{p},
        \]
        where \(h\) is Planck's constant. For electrons accelerated through
        a potential difference, this wavelength is small but still large
        enough to be detected in diffraction experiments.
      </p>

      <h2>Interpreting the Wave</h2>
      <p>
        The wave associated with an electron is described mathematically by
        a wavefunction \(\psi\). The probability of detecting the electron
        at a particular position is proportional to \(|\psi|^2\). In a
        diffraction experiment, the bright regions of the pattern correspond
        to positions where \(|\psi|^2\) is large due to constructive
        interference.
      </p>

      <h2>Single-Electron Build Up</h2>
      <p>
        A striking demonstration of wave–particle duality occurs when the
        experiment is carried out using a very low intensity electron beam.
        At first, single dots appear one by one on the detector, consistent
        with particle-like impacts. Over time, however, the dots build up to
        form the same interference pattern observed with a more intense beam.
      </p>

      <p>
        This behaviour suggests that each electron passes through the crystal
        as a delocalized wave, but is detected as a localized particle. The
        interference pattern reflects the wave nature, while the individual
        detection events show the particle nature.
