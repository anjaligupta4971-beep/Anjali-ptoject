      <h1>Thermodynamics: Heat, Work, and Energy Transfer</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Topic: Thermodynamics · Level: College Physics

      <p>
        Thermodynamics describes how energy is transferred between systems and
        their surroundings through heat and work. The first law of
        thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only
        transferred or converted from one form to another.
      </p>

      <h2>The First Law of Thermodynamics</h2>
      <p>
        The first law is expressed as:
        \[
          \Delta U = Q - W,
        \]
        where \(\Delta U\) is the change in internal energy of the system,
        \(Q\) is the heat added to the system, and \(W\) is the work done by
        the system. This equation shows that the internal energy of a system
        increases when heat is added or work is done on the system.
      </p>

      <h2>Heat and Temperature</h2>
      <p>
        Heat is energy transferred due to a temperature difference. When two
        objects at different temperatures come into contact, heat flows from the
        hotter object to the colder one until thermal equilibrium is reached.
        The amount of heat transferred depends on the mass, specific heat
        capacity, and temperature change:
        \[
          Q = mc\Delta T,
        \]
        where \(m\) is mass, \(c\) is specific heat capacity, and \(\Delta T\)
        is the temperature change.
      </p>

      <h2>Work in Thermodynamics</h2>
      <p>
        In thermodynamics, work is often associated with the expansion or
        compression of a gas. When a gas expands, it does work on its
        surroundings. For a constant pressure process, the work done is:
        \[
          W = P\Delta V,
        \]
        where \(P\) is pressure and \(\Delta V\) is the change in volume.
      </p>

      <h2>Energy Conservation</h2>
      <p>
        The first law emphasizes that energy is conserved. In any process, the
        total energy of the universe remains constant. Energy may be converted
        from kinetic to potential, from thermal to mechanical, or between
        various other forms, but the total amount never changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding thermodynamics is crucial for analyzing engines,
        refrigerators, and various energy conversion processes. It helps explain
        why certain processes are possible while others are not, and provides
        the foundation for understanding efficiency in energy systems.
