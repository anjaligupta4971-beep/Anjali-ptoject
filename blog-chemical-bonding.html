      <h1>Understanding Chemical Bonding: Ionic vs Covalent</h1>
      <p class="meta">
        Topic: Chemical Bonding · Level: General Chemistry
      </p>

      <p>
        Chemical bonds form when atoms interact to achieve more stable electron
        configurations. The two primary types of chemical bonds are ionic and
        covalent, each with distinct characteristics and formation mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>Ionic Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Ionic bonds result from the complete transfer of electrons from one atom
        to another, typically between a metal and a non-metal. The metal atom
        loses electrons to become a positively charged cation, while the
        non-metal gains electrons to become a negatively charged anion. The
        electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms
        the ionic bond.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium donates its single
        valence electron to chlorine, forming Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. The resulting
        crystal lattice structure is held together by strong electrostatic
        forces, giving ionic compounds high melting and boiling points.
      </p>

      <h2>Covalent Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons to achieve stable electron
        configurations. This typically occurs between non-metal atoms. In a
        covalent bond, the shared electrons are attracted to both nuclei,
        creating a stable molecular structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, in a water molecule (H₂O), each hydrogen atom shares its
        single electron with oxygen, while oxygen shares two of its electrons
        with the hydrogen atoms. This sharing results in a stable molecule where
        all atoms have complete outer electron shells.
      </p>

      <h2>Polar vs Non-Polar Covalent Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        When atoms with different electronegativities form covalent bonds, the
        shared electrons are not equally distributed. This creates a polar
        covalent bond, where one end of the bond is slightly positive and the
        other is slightly negative. In non-polar covalent bonds, atoms have
        similar electronegativities, resulting in equal electron sharing.
      </p>

      <h2>Bond Strength and Properties</h2>
      <p>
        Ionic bonds are generally stronger than covalent bonds due to the
        complete charge separation. However, covalent bonds can be very strong,
        especially in molecules like nitrogen (N₂) with triple bonds. The type
        of bonding significantly influences physical properties such as melting
        point, solubility, and electrical conductivity.
